# Z shell snap

This project creates a snap of the Z shell.
A shell is interesting because it conflicts with the isolation principle of
snaps, so it is a nice experiment for the playpen.

## Current state

Working features:
 - In devmode, everything should work. More testing is needed to identify
   potential problems in devmode.

Known issues:
 - Not much will work without devmode.
