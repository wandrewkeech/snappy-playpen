description: |
    ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you
    to play LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and
    Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.
    ResidualVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games,
    allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!
